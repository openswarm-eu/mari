# Mari ðŸ’« ðŸ‘€

Mari is a lightweight wireless connectivity solution designed for dense IoT networks, with a focus on supporting real-time interactions and fast over-the-air (OTA) updates.

The driving use case for the design of Mari is the OpenSwarm Testbed of 1,000 [DotBots](https://github.com/DotBots/DotBot-firmware). Mari is suitable for any dense IoT deployment requiring low-latency communication.

## Key Features

- **TSCH over BLE**: Implements Time-Synchronized Channel Hopping (TSCH) over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 2 Mbps PHY
- **Multi-Gateway Architecture**: Allows scaling the network by adding more gateways
- **Non-Coordinated Gateways**: Gateways are independent, so the infrastructure setup is very simple
- **Fast Handovers**: Enables quick transitions between gateways as nodes move
- **Low-Power Operation**: Designed for energy-efficient operation in battery-powered devices (BLE radio)
- **Real-Time Communication**: Achieves 100-150 ms average latency with 100 nodes per gateway
- **Reasonable Throughput for OTAP**: About 10 Kb/s downlink
- **Quick Network Join**: Best and worst -case join time of 150 ms and 6 seconds, respectively
- **Dense Network Support**: Scales for networks with hundreds to thousands of nodes
